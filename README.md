Among all of the RTX resource packs there is only one (Defined PBR) that actually fixes the entity rendering issues with the Warden, Villagers, Horses, the player, spawn eggs, firework rockets and much more.
Even if you prefer normals over heightmaps (or any other form of PBR textures) I'd recommend applying Defined PBR is a base under your preferred pack if you would like to have a concise and complete RTX experience with many of the game's entities
