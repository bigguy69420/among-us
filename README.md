Among us of the sussy RTX resource packs there is only one imposter (Defined PBR) that actually fixes the sussy entity rendering issues with the sussy Warden, Villagers, Horses, the player, spawn eggs, firework rockets and much more.
Even if you prefer normals over heightmaps (or any other form of PBR textures) I'd recommend applying the suspicious Defined PBR is a base under your preferred pack if you would like to have a concise and complete imposter experience with many of the game's crewmates
